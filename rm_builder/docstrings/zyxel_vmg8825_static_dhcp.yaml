notes:
  - Tested against Zyxel VMG8825-T50
  - Configuration is merged using the 'mac_addr' value and not the 'index' value
options:
  config:
    description: The provided configuration
    type: list
    elements: dict
    suboptions:
      index:
        description:
        - Index of the entry. Note that this field has no use in updating configuration.
          Entries are updated based on their mac_addr
        type: int
      enable:
        description:
        - True is the entry should be active
        type: bool
        default: true
      br_wan:
        description:
        - BrWan. Most likely this will be the value 'Default'
        - On Zyxel VMG8825 this matches with IpIfacePath=IP.Interface.1, Type=LAN, Name=Default
        type: str
        default: Default
      mac_addr:
        description:
        - MAC address.
        - This is also used as the primary key for updating entries in the device.
          Changing this value will result in deleting the old entry and adding a new one
        type: str
        required: true
      ip_addr:
        description:
        - IP address
        type: str
        required: true
  running_config:
    description:
    - This option is used only with state I(parsed).
    - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and
      transforms it into Ansible structured data as per the resource module's argspec
      and the value is then returned in the I(parsed) key within the result.
    type: str
  state:
    description:
    - The state the configuration should be left in
    type: str
    choices:
    - merged
    - replaced
    - overridden
    - deleted
    - gathered
    - rendered
    - parsed
